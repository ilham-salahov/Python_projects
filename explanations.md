# Python_projects
Here are the Python projects that i have worked during my studies at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg

1. GoMomentum: A stock selection tool based on short-run momentum market anomaly. Here, we take the universe of stocks and filter them based on their previous 
   returns from the look-back window (past 12 month). We long the winners(securiteis in the top quintile) and / or short the losers(securities in the bottom quintile)
   and then illsutrate the selcted portfolio and comare it to the benchmark portfolio. In this case S&P 500. 
   
2. Computational Finance and Finacial Management project: Here i was given 100.000 eur and 3 assets where I had to cfind MVP, Optimal Portfolio and run a time series asalysis

3. CAPM and Fama French analysis: In this project i was given the task of running the regerssion with CAPM and Fama French three factor models and find the betas

4. Financial Engineering project: In this project i had to find the implied volatility of an option with BSM formula - by back solving it and run a time series analysis
   on the underlying asset
